# Movies_Predection_Application
An app to use classification methods to predict the success of a movie 
(This application is part of a project in data Mining at INSAT with two other colleagues) 

We used Angular 7 for the front end and Python for the Backend (using Flask for the API)
The original dataSet is from Kaggle. We analyse it and clean it to finally obtain "dataset.csv".
There are 5 classes :
  * Block-Buster (4)
  * Super-Hit (3)
  * Hit (2)
  * Average (1)
  * Flop (0)
  
This application has 3 main functionalities which are :
  - Predicting  the success of Movie through a formula.
  - Evaluating the different used Algorithms by showing different error's values.
  - Testing lines from the dataSet and comparing the prediction  with the actual value of the class

INSTALL

 * Download Front_end and back_end directories 
 * Run the API2 for the background
 * Run the Front_end angular application ( make sure to do npm install to dowload node_modules)
